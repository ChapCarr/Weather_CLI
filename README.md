# CLI Weather App in Go
## A simple CLI weather app that can give basic weather for a given city

This is a CLI weather app that I wrote as a first project to help myself learn go. It allows a user to input a city name and be able to quickly see the weather.

Currently there are plans to add more functionality in particular a GUI for users to interact with instead of the command line.

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or higher
- An API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## Installation 

1. **Clone this repo**
 ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chapcarr/weather-api-project.git
    cd weather-api-project
  ```
2. **Create key.txt**
  In the project directory create a file 'key.txt' and then past your API key directly into it

3 **Run the program**
  ```bash
    go run main.go
  ```
