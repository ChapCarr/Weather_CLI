# CLI Weather App in Go
## A simple CLI weather app that can give basic weather for a given city

This is a CLI weather app that I wrote as a first project to help myself learn go. It allows a user to input a city name and be able to quickly see the weather.

Currently there are plans to add more functionality in particular a GUI for users to interact with instead of the command line.

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or higher
- An API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## Installation 

1. **Clone this repo**
 ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChapCarr/Weather_CLI.git
    cd Weather_CLI
  ```
2. **Create key.txt**

   1. Go to project directory
   2. Create file named "key.txt"
   3. Paste your API key into file

3 **Run the program**
  ```bash
    go run main.go
  ```
