# CLI Weather App in Go
## A simple CLI weather app that can give basic weather for a given city

This is a CLI weather app that I wrote as a first project to help myself learn go. It allows a user to input a city name and be able to quickly see the weather.

Currently there are plans to add more functionality in particular a GUI for users to interact with instead of the command line.
